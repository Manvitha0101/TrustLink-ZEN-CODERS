TrustLink – AI-Powered Fraud & Scam Detection System
Team ZEN CODERS
📌 Project Overview

TrustLink is an AI-powered platform designed to detect, categorize, and prevent fraudulent online content before it reaches users. The system focuses on securing communication in colleges, corporates, and organizations by ensuring that only verified members can participate and all shared links or applications are scanned using AI/ML models.

🚩 Problem

Online scams like fake websites, phishing domains, and fraudulent mobile apps are increasing rapidly.

Students and professionals are often added to unverified groups where fake internships and scam offers spread.

Current detection methods are reactive and rely on user reports or takedowns, which come too late.

There is no proactive system that warns users in real time.

💡 Our Solution – TrustLink Platform

TrustLink is a secure, domain-based communication hub with built-in AI/ML fraud detection.

Verified Access: Only college or corporate email IDs can join.

AI/ML Detection: Scans messages, links, and apps for fraud patterns.

Secure Link Repository: Centralized trusted links for all members.

Real-Time Alerts: Users are notified immediately if content is flagged.

Multi-Organization Support: Works for colleges, corporates, and other institutions.

⚙️ How It Works

User logs in with a verified college/corporate email.

When a message, link, or app is shared → it passes through the AI/ML layer.

NLP: Detects scam or phishing language.

Computer Vision: Compares website UI to known brands.

Metadata: Analyzes WHOIS, domain age, app permissions, etc.

Risk scoring is applied.

✅ Safe → Message delivered.

⚠️ Suspicious → Flagged and sent for admin/faculty review.

Real-time alerts keep students and faculty informed.
